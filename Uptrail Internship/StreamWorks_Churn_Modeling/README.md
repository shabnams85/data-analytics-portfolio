# Churn Prediction â€“ StreamWorks Media

This project involved customer churn analysis for StreamWorks Media, a UK-based streaming platform.

## Objectives
- Understand churn behaviour and influencing factors
- Predict churn likelihood using logistic regression
- Identify drivers of engagement and watch time

## Techniques Used
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Logistic regression for churn classification
- Linear regression for predicting watch time
- Chi-square, t-tests, Pearson correlation
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, AUC, F1 Score

## Key Findings
- `watch_per_fee_ratio` is the strongest predictor of both churn and engagement
- Promotions slightly reduce churn, but require better targeting
- Middle-aged users and low-engagement customers are most at-risk

## Tools
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
